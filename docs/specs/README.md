# Bharat-Setu Feature Specifications

This directory contains the feature specifications for the Bharat-Setu project. Each feature follows a structured specification process with requirements, design, and implementation tasks.

## Available Specifications

### [Bharat-Setu Core Feature](./bharat-setu/README.md)
The main feature specification for the multilingual AI scheme navigator system.

- [Requirements](./bharat-setu/requirements.md) - User stories and acceptance criteria
- [Design](./bharat-setu/design.md) - Technical design and architecture
- [Tasks](./bharat-setu/tasks.md) - Implementation task list

## Specification Process

Each feature specification follows this workflow:

1. **Requirements** - Define user stories and acceptance criteria
2. **Design** - Create technical design with correctness properties
3. **Tasks** - Break down implementation into actionable tasks
4. **Implementation** - Execute tasks with property-based testing

## Working with Specifications

To work with a specification:

1. Review the requirements document to understand the feature goals
2. Study the design document for technical implementation details
3. Follow the tasks document for step-by-step implementation
4. Run property-based tests to verify correctness

For more information about the specification-driven development process, see the main [project documentation](../README.md).
